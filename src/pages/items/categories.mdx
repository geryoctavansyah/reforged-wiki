| Heavy      | This type is designed to provide maximum protection by increasing Hit Points (HP) and High Damage Reduction. However, the user must sacrifice agility, so movements become slower. |
| Medium     | This type offers the perfect balance between Durability and Agility. Users get pretty good protection without losing the Ability to move quickly.                                  |
| Light      | This type focuses on Agility and Speed. Users gain huge bonuses in Speed and Dodge Ability, but must compromise with lower Protection and less Hit Points (HP).                    |
